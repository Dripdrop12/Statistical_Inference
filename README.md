## Course Project
In this project I investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter. The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda. Lambda = 0.2 for all of the simulations. Then I investigate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials with a thousand simulations.

The report illustrates via simulation the properties of the distribution of the mean of 40 exponentials in order to 

1. Compare the sample mean and the theoretical mean of the distribution.

2. Compare the sample variance and the theoretical variance of the distribution.

3. Show that the distribution is approximately normal.
